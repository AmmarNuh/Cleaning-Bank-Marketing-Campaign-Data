# Cleaning-Bank-Marketing-Campaign-Data

**Project Instructions**
Subset, clean, and reformat the bank_marketing.csv dataset to create and store three new files based on the requirements detailed in the notebook.

- Split and tidy bank_marketing.csv, storing as three DataFrames called client, campaign, and economics, each containing the columns outlined in the notebook and formatted to the data types listed.
- Save the three DataFrames to csv files, without an index, as client.csv, campaign.csv, and economics.csv respectively.

- Personal loans are a lucrative revenue stream for banks. The typical interest rate of a two-year loan in the United Kingdom is around 10%. This might not sound like a lot, but in September 2022 alone UK consumers borrowed around £1.5 billion, which would mean approximately £300 million in interest generated by banks over two years!

I have been asked to work with a bank to clean the data they collected as part of a recent marketing campaign, which aimed to get customers to take out a personal loan. They plan to conduct more marketing campaigns going forward so would like me to ensure it conforms to the specific structure and data types that they specify so that they can then use the cleaned data I provide to set up a PostgreSQL database, which will store this campaign's data and allow data from future campaigns to be easily imported.

They have supplied you with a csv file called "bank_marketing.csv", which I will need to clean, reformat, and split the data, saving three final csv files. Specifically, the three files should have the names and contents as outlined below:

## `client.csv`

| column | data type | description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| `client_id` | `integer` | Client ID |
| `age` | `integer` | Client's age in years |
| `job` | `object` | Client's type of job |
| `marital` | `object` | Client's marital status |
| `education` | `object` | Client's level of education |
| `credit_default` | `bool` | Whether the client's credit is in default |
| `mortgage` | `bool` | Whether the client has an existing mortgage (housing loan) |

## `campaign.csv`

| column | data type | description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| `client_id` | `integer` | Client ID |
| `number_contacts` | `integer` | Number of contact attempts to the client in the current campaign |
| `contact_duration` | `integer` | Last contact duration in seconds |
| `previous_campaign_contacts` | `integer` | Number of contact attempts to the client in the previous campaign |
| `previous_outcome` | `bool` | Outcome of the previous campaign |
| `campaign_outcome` | `bool` | Outcome of the current campaign |
| `last_contact_date` | `datetime` | Last date the client was contacted |

## `economics.csv`

| column | data type | description | 
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| `client_id` | `integer` | Client ID |
| `cons_price_idx` | `float` | Consumer price index (monthly indicator) |
| `euribor_three_months` | `float` | Euro Interbank Offered Rate (euribor) three-month rate (daily indicator) |
